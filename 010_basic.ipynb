But as soon as we increas the number of *sessions* (or loops) the end value gets buggy. This, because the Python interpreter and also the OS can interrupt the current thread and give the CPU to another thread. Unfortunatelly, this context-switch can happen in the middle of the `x += 1` instruction, which translates into: `LOAD x, INC x, STORE x`"
